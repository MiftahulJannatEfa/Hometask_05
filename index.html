    <h1>THE HUMAN JOURNEY</h1>
    <p> We face a world that is far different from our ancestor’s.<span>But we have the
            potential to understand and solve the problems of today,</span> many of which are man-made, if we first
        understand who
        we are, and how the past has made us. We must know what is unchanging about human nature and recognize what we
        can and must consciously change to ensure the future for ourselves and our planet.The Human Journey is the
        journey of the human mind, how it developed, the world it made and the problems it solved, why and how it solved
        them; and how those solutions affected its evolution and subsequent decisions.</p>

    <span class="para">The human brain is flexible. It has enabled us to adapt, survive, and even flourish all over the
        world. We are the only animals that can do this. But this flexibility has a downside: we are easily manipulated
        and influenced by the group or culture in which we find ourselves. We are wired to be social animals, to connect
        beyond our immediate circle, but we too often limit ourselves to thinking in terms of “Us and Them.”
